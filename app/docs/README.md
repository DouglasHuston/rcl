### Find a church

There are several ways to find a congregation on the map.  You may do any of the following:

* Permit your browser to know your geographical location and center the map on your location.
* Enter a search term into the search box to:
  * search for a geographical location or known place (business, etc.) name on which to center the map.
  * search for congregations whose name, address, city, state, zip, or other details match your 
    search term.  To search in this manner, select the "Keywords only" checkbox.
* Scroll and pan the map.

To filter the list of congregations which will be searched and displayed on the map,

* Type the name or abbreviation of a denomination into the "Denomination" box.
* Click on that denomination when it appears below the search box.

To no longer filter for a denomination, click on that denomination where it appears above the
denomination filter box.
