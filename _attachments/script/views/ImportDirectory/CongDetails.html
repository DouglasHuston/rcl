<h2>Step 5:  Select congregation details</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The interface below allows you to tell us where each piece of data about this congregation is located 
            in the HTML of the page.
        </li>
        <li>
            For each field listed below, please click in the field's text box, then highlight that field's content where
            it appears in the page below.
        </li>
        <li>
            Behind the scenes, this page will use your selected text to create a regular expression that will attempt to 
            extract that field's data from the web page.  Then it will display the data it extracted in that field's text box.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once that data displays in the text box, please confirm whether the data is correct.  If it is correct, simply 
            move on to the next text box.  If it is not correct, please click the button that says "No, this isn't right" 
            and our code will modify the regular expression and try again.  You may click the "No, this isn't right button 
            more than once.  Every time you click it, our code expands the regular expression to include more context around 
            the data you have selected, to attempt to help the regular expression better recognize the specific piece of data
            you have selected.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you would like to modify the regular expression yourself, you may do so in the "Regular Expression" box at the 
            bottom of the page.  We encourage you to do so.  You can read documentation about the regular expression syntax at
            <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_regexp.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions" target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network</a>.

        <p>
            Please replace text that should NOT be part of the regex 
            (because it is data that should go into another field)
            with this expression:  <code>.*?</code>

            For example, if you are choosing the mailing state, change this:<br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp;<code>P\\\.O\\\. Box 873741&lt;br&gt;Wasilla, (?P&lt;mailing_state&gt;.+) 99687-3741</code><br />
            into this:<br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp;<code>.*?&lt;br&gt;.*?, (?P&lt;mailing_state&gt;.+) .*?</code>
